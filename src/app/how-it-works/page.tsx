There is no learning curve, no confusing dashboard, and no expensive courses to buy. Whether you are a student in a hostel, a mum at home, a boda boda rider between trips, or a professional in the office \u2014 you can start earning referral income Kenya within minutes of joining. We have simplified everything so that your focus stays on what matters most: sharing the opportunity and watching your M-Pesa commissions grow.

Think of it not as a cost, but as an investment that pays for itself almost immediately \u2014 after just 3 referrals (KES 600), you have already earned back your KES 500 and are KES 100 in profit. Everything after that is pure income flowing straight to your M-Pesa.

You also get access to ready-made WhatsApp and social media templates that make sharing your link as easy as copy-paste. The entire process takes less than 5 minutes from payment to having your link ready to share.
