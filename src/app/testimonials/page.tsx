  { name: "Sarah M.", location: "Nairobi", text: "I joined SonkoPesa three months ago with zero expectations. I had tried other side hustles before — selling products, freelance writing, even digital marketing — and nothing ever stuck. But this was different. I simply shared my referral link on my WhatsApp status and within my church group. In my first week, 10 friends joined using my link. I made KES 2,000 before I even fully understood what was happening. Today, three months in, I have earned KES 8,000. That is money that has helped me pay my son's school fees without stress. I have never had to explain, justify, or sell anything. I just shared my experience and people wanted to join too.", stars: 5, amount: "KES 12,250", joined: "3 months ago" },
  { name: "James K.", location: "Mombasa", text: "I left my sales job six months ago because I realized I was working 12-hour days for peanuts. A friend told me about SonkoPesa and I saw the potential immediately. The math was simple — KES 200 per referral, unlimited potential. I started sharing my link on social media, WhatsApp groups, and even printed flyers for my estate in Mombasa. Today I have referred 50 people directly and earn KES 10,000 every month from my referrals. That is more than I made at my job, and I work half the hours. No boss, no commute, no nonsense.", stars: 5, amount: "KES 45,000", joined: "6 months ago" },
  { name: "Grace W.", location: "Kisumu", text: "I was skeptical at first. Who would not be? A platform that pays you for referring people sounds too good to be true. But I read through the entire website, saw the transparent breakdown of how KES 500 is distributed, and decided to take a chance on KES 500. That is less than what I spend on airtime in a month. I referred my sister, my neighbor, and my colleague at work. Three people. I made my KES 500 back instantly. That was the moment I knew this was real. Today I have referred 24 people and earned KES 8,400. For someone in Kisumu, that is life-changing money. I no longer have to choose between transport fare and buying lunch.", stars: 5, amount: "KES 8,400", joined: "2 months ago" },
  { name: "Daniel O.", location: "Nakuru", text: "The transparency is what won me over. No hidden fees, no confusing fine print, no monthly targets you have to hit before you qualify for commissions. Just clean, straightforward math — KES 200 per direct referral. I have referred 25 people and earned KES 5,000 and I earn consistently every month without fail. The M-Pesa payments arrive instantly, usually within 30 seconds of someone joining. I have tried other referral programs before and they always find reasons to delay or deny payments. SonkoPesa is different. They pay what they promise, when they promise it. That is rare in Kenya and I respect it.", stars: 5, amount: "KES 15,750", joined: "4 months ago" },
  { name: "Lucy N.", location: "Thika", text: "As a university student in Thika, I needed a way to make money that would not interfere with my classes. I cannot work a regular job because of my lecture schedule, and most online opportunities require skills I am still learning. SonkoPesa was the perfect solution. I share my referral link on WhatsApp groups — my class groups, my church youth group, even my family group — and I earn KES 200 each time someone joins. It is that simple. I have earned KES 7,000 so far and it has covered my hostel rent and food for two months. My friends think I am lucky. I tell them it is not luck — it is just being part of the right platform at the right time.", stars: 5, amount: "KES 7,000", joined: "2 months ago" },
