const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to join?",
    a: "A one-time membership fee of KES 500 — and you get KES 200 bonus instantly credited. That’s 40% back on day one. No recurring charges, no hidden fees, no monthly subscriptions, no annual renewals, no maintenance costs — just a single payment that gives you lifetime access to the referral platform. You pay once and earn forever. Many people ask if there are any other costs down the line, and the answer is always no. Whether you refer one person or one thousand, you never pay another shilling. This is what makes SonkoPesa different from every other opportunity out there. When you see platforms charging monthly fees or requiring minimum purchases, you know they are not built for your success. We are different because we only win when you win.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I earn?",
    a: "You earn KES 200 for every person who joins through your referral link. That is a 40% commission on the KES 500 membership fee, which is one of the highest commission rates you will find anywhere. This is a single-level model: you earn only from people YOU directly invite. No second level or hidden tiers. There is no limit to how many people you can refer or how much you can earn. Some of our top members earn KES 10,000+ per month simply by sharing their link consistently. A few dedicated members earn KES 50,000 or more. Your income is directly tied to your effort, and there is no ceiling holding you back.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to sell anything?",
    a: "No. This is a pure referral platform. There are no products to sell, no inventory to manage, no minimum purchase targets to hit, no sales quotas to meet, and no monthly volume requirements. You are simply sharing an opportunity with people who might be interested in earning extra income themselves. Think of it like recommending a good restaurant to a friend — you are not selling anything, you are just sharing something valuable that has worked for you. The platform handles everything else. When someone joins through your link, they become a member with the same benefits you enjoy. They do not buy a product; they join a community.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get paid?",
    a: "Payments are sent directly to your M-Pesa immediately when someone joins using your referral link. There is no minimum payout threshold, no waiting for end of month, no processing delays, no approval queues, and no manual verification steps. The money hits your phone instantly. If you refer someone at 3 PM, you will see the M-Pesa message before 3:05 PM. You can use the money immediately — withdraw it at an agent, send it to family, buy airtime, pay for goods, or transfer it to your bank. It is your money, and you get it right away. This instant payment system is one of the most appreciated features of our platform because it gives you immediate financial feedback.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a pyramid scheme?",
    a: "No. Absolutely not. SonkoPesa is a legitimate referral-based income platform that is fully compliant with Kenyan regulations. Pyramid schemes are illegal because they require payment for the right to recruit others and they promise returns that come primarily from recruiting, not from any underlying product or service. Our model is completely different. You earn commissions when real people choose to join a real platform that provides real value — the ability to earn referral income themselves. There are no recruitment targets, no penalties for inactivity, no complex compensation plans designed to confuse you. We are transparent about how everything works, and we welcome scrutiny from regulators, journalists, or anyone who wants to understand our model.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I join from anywhere in Kenya?",
    a: "Yes. As long as you have M-Pesa and some form of internet access — even basic mobile data on a feature phone — you can join and start earning from anywhere in the country. Whether you are in Nairobi's CBD, Kisumu's lakeside, Mombasa's coast, Nakuru's town centre, Eldoret, Nyeri, Machakos, or a rural village in Baringo, Turkana, or Taita Taveta, the platform works exactly the same way. You do not need a smartphone, though it makes things easier. A basic phone with internet capability is enough to register and share your link. Location has never been a barrier to earning with SonkoPesa, and we are proud that our members come from every corner of Kenya.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I stop referring?",
    a: "If you stop referring, you simply stop earning new commissions. That is it. Any commissions you have already earned and that have been processed remain yours permanently — we never claw back paid commissions. There are no penalties for inactivity, no account closure due to dormancy, no reactivation fees, and no loss of your team. Your account stays active indefinitely. You can take a break for six months, travel, focus on other priorities, come back, and pick up right where you left off. This flexibility is especially valuable for students during exam periods, parents during busy seasons like December, or anyone whose life circumstances change. With SonkoPesa, you are always in control.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly do I get paid?",
    a: "Instantly. The moment someone joins through your link and completes their KES 500 membership payment, your KES 200 commission is triggered and sent to your M-Pesa automatically. There are absolutely no delays, no processing queues, no manual approval steps, no waiting for a payout run at the end of the week. The entire system is fully automated and works in real time. Many of our members report receiving their M-Pesa notification within 60 seconds of their referral completing registration. This instant payment system is one of the main reasons people love and trust SonkoPesa — because you see the results of your effort immediately, not after a long waiting period.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SonkoPesa registered in Kenya?",
    a: "Yes, SonkoPesa is fully registered and compliant with all relevant Kenyan business regulations. We operate transparently under Kenyan law and follow all applicable rules governing digital platforms and referral-based income models in Kenya. Our headquarters are based in Nairobi, and we work exclusively with local payment providers to ensure seamless M-Pesa integration. You can be completely confident that you are joining a legitimate, professionally run organisation that is here for the long term. We are not some foreign company trying to extract money from Kenyans — we are Kenyans, building for Kenyans, and we are committed to operating with integrity and transparency at every level.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't know anyone to refer?",
    a: "You know more people than you realise. Most of us interact with dozens of people every single day without thinking about it. Start with your immediate circle: family members, close friends, neighbours, church members, former classmates from primary and secondary school, colleagues from previous jobs, people in your WhatsApp groups, parents at your children's school, your boda boda rider, your regular shopkeeper. Most people have 50 to 100 people in their natural network without even realising it. We also provide training materials, pre-written messages, graphics, and sharing tips to help you expand your reach and communicate effectively. Many of our most successful members started with just five close contacts and grew from there. You do not need a big network — you just need to start with the people who already know and trust you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use my wife's or husband's M-Pesa to receive payments?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. You can use any M-Pesa number that you have access to, whether it is your own, your spouse's, your parent's, your sibling's, or even a trusted friend's. Many of our members use a family member's M-Pesa line if they do not have their own line or if their own line is registered in someone else's name. The important thing is that the number you register with is one where you can reliably receive money. You can also update your M-Pesa number later if needed by simply contacting our support team. We understand that not every Kenyan has their own personal M-Pesa line, especially younger members or those in rural areas, and we have designed the platform to be flexible enough to accommodate everyone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to see results?",
    a: "This varies from person to person, but many of our members earn their first commission within hours of joining simply by sharing their link with a few close contacts. For most people, it takes between a few days and a week to get their first referral. The key factors are consistency and activity — share your link daily in different places, talk to people about the opportunity naturally, and follow up with those who show interest. Unlike traditional employment where you work an entire month before seeing a salary, referral income can start flowing from the very first day. Your first KES 200 could be in your M-Pesa today if you share your link with the right person. Some of our most committed members earn their first KES 500 within their first week.",
  },

const myths = [
  {
    myth: "It is a pyramid scheme",
    reality: "Pyramid schemes are illegal because they inevitably collapse when recruitment slows down, leaving most participants with losses. SonkoPesa is fundamentally different. We are a sustainable referral-based platform that provides ongoing value to every member regardless of whether they recruit others. The platform does not depend on endless recruitment to survive. Members earn commissions for introducing new people to a legitimate service, and the platform continues operating normally regardless of growth rate. There are no recruitment fees beyond the one-time KES 500 membership, no pressure to recruit a minimum number of people, and the business model is transparent and simple. We welcome any scrutiny because we have nothing to hide. Our model is legal, ethical, and built to last.",
    icon: XCircle,
  },
  {
    myth: "You need to recruit many people to earn anything meaningful",
    reality: "Even a single referral earns you KES 200 instantly — that is real money you can use immediately for airtime, food, transport, or anything else. You do not need a large team to see value from SonkoPesa. Many of our members are perfectly happy earning an extra KES 500 to KES 3,000 per month by referring just a handful of people. That extra income can make a real difference — covering your daily transport, buying data bundles, or treating your family on the weekend. The signup bonus of KES 200 unlocks after 5 referrals and is a one-time welcome reward. You earn at your own pace, at your own comfort level, with no pressure from anyone.",
    icon: XCircle,
  },
  {
    myth: "Only people in Nairobi can earn good money",
    reality: "This could not be further from the truth. Some of our most successful and highest-earning members are based in rural areas and smaller towns far from Nairobi. Since the entire platform operates through M-Pesa and mobile internet, your physical location is completely irrelevant to your earning potential. A member in Busia County can earn just as much as a member in Kilimani, Nairobi. In fact, members in less saturated areas often find it easier to grow their network quickly because the concept of referral-based income is newer and more exciting to people in their community. When everyone in Nairobi is already being bombarded with opportunities, being the first person in your rural town to introduce this concept gives you a massive advantage.",
    icon: XCircle,
  },
  {
    myth: "You need special skills, experience, or a large social media following",
    reality: "If you can share a link, you can earn. There is absolutely no training course required, no technical expertise needed, no sales experience necessary, and no social media following required. The platform handles everything automatically — tracking referrals, processing payments, managing accounts. Your only job is to let people know that the opportunity exists. We provide ready-made messages, graphics, and promotional resources so you do not even need to write your own content or design your own materials. If you can use WhatsApp to send a message to a friend, you already have all the skills you need to succeed with SonkoPesa. It really is that simple.",

              Not everyone finds their answer in a FAQ page, and that is okay. Some questions need a conversation, not a paragraph. If you are still unsure about anything — cost, process, timing, or whether this is right for you — please talk to us. We have helped thousands of Kenyans make this decision, and we would be honoured to help you too.

                  We understand that every person's situation is different. Maybe your specific concern was not covered above, or maybe you need a more personal conversation to feel completely confident before joining. That is completely understandable, and we welcome it. In fact, we prefer that you ask every question you have rather than join with doubts.

That is how we treat every single person who reaches out to us.
